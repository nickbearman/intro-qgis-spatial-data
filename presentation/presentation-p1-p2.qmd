## Any Questions?

- ?


## What is GIS?

-   Geographical Information Systems
-   Turning (spatial) data into information ![](images/turning-data-into-information.png)
-   Using this information to answer (research) questions
    -   *"How have housing conditions changed in the past ten years?"*
    -   *"Where are groups of patients more likely to be suffering from obesity?"*

## What can a GIS can answer?

## GIS

-   Nearly all human activities & decisions involve geography
    -   the "**where?**"
-   Working with geographic information is **different** to working with a **CSV** or **Excel** file
-   This is why we need specialized **GIS** software to:
    -   **organize** and **store**
    -   **access** and **retrieve**
    -   **present** and **manage** spatial data
-   But ultimately to apply to the solution of our **problem**

## GIS can be applied to many many many different areas

## GIS Software

![](images/gis-software.png)\

- QGIS has as many features as ArcGIS Pro
- ArcGIS Pro is probably slightly more polished
- QGIS is free (as is R & RStudio)
- QGIS is popular in not for profit sector, academic and commercial
- *All can be useful*

## Projections and Coordinate Systems

## Projections

- Projection - going from a sphere to a flat surface

## Why are Projections important?

1. The map(s) may not be as they appear

## Why are Projections important?

1. The map(s) may not be as they appear
2. Data may appear in the wrong place

![](images/base-map-uk-data.png)

## Why are Projections important?

1. The map(s) may not be as they appear
2. Data may appear in the wrong place
3. Projections are closely related to Coordinate Systems

## Coordinate Systems

Latitude and Longitude (WGS 1984)

*52°N 37' 30.32'' (52.6250) 1°E 14' 2.05'' (1.2339)*

 ![](images/lat-lng.png)

## Coordinate Systems

British National Grid  

*Easting: 619301	Northing: 307416* 


![](images/bng.png)		

## Coordinate Systems

 UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)

 *621160.98, 3349893.53 meters, Zone 31 N*

 ![](images/utm.png)

## Geographic and Projected Coordinate Systems

We can split these coordinate systems into two groups:

- Geographic Coordinate Systems
- Projected Coordinate Systems

## Geographic and Projected Coordinate Systems

- **Geographic Coordinate Systems**
  - Where on the Earth’s surface something is
  - 52°N 37’ 30.32’’ (52.6250)	1°E 14’ 2.05’’ (1.2339) 
  - Usually in angular units (degrees)
  - But measuring distances is hard

## Geographic and Projected Coordinate Systems

- **Geographic Coordinate Systems**
  - Where on the Earth’s surface something is
  - 52°N 37’ 30.32’’ (52.6250)	1°E 14’ 2.05’’ (1.2339) 
  - Usually in angular units (degrees)
- **Projected Coordinate Systems**
  - How we show this on a printed/flat map
  - Easting: 619301	Northing: 307416
  - Usually in linear units (meters)


## Geographic and Projected Coordinate Systems

- **Geographic Coordinate Systems**
  - Latitude and Longitude (WGS 1984)
  - 52.6250°	1.2339°
- **Projected Coordinate Systems**
  - British National Grid (Eastings & Northings)
    - Easting: 619301	Northing: 307416
  - UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
    - 621160.98, 3349893.53 meters, Zone 14 N

## Coordinate Systems

- **Geographic** : Latitude and Longitude (WGS 1984)
  - 52.6250°	1.2339° **EPSG: 4326**
- **Projected Coordinate Systems**
  - British National Grid (Eastings & Northings)
    - Easting: 619301	Northing: 307416 **EPSG: 27700**
  - UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
    - 621160.98, 3349893.53 meters, Zone 14 N **EPSG: depends on zone**
- [https://epsg.org/](https://epsg.org/) | [https://epsg.io/](https://epsg.io/)

## Geographic and Projected Coordinate Systems

- Why is it important?
  - Some data uses WGS84, some BNG, some UTM
  - GB ONS (LSOA) / OS and many others use BNG (Eastings/Northings)
  - Need to convert between the two
- Most of the time QGIS converts automatically



## Which system to use?

- For Global data, projections are key
  - WGS 84 EPSG:4326
  - Try WGS 84 / Equal Earth Greenwich EPSG:8857

- For Local data, projections are less important
  - We are using Projected Coordinate System
  
  
- We can convert data between projection systems

## Attribute Join

- The attribute is key
- It must match **exactly**
	- “Gambia, The” ≠ “The Gambia”
	- “USA” ≠ “The United States”
	- “UK” ≠ “Great Britain”
	
	
## Attribute Join

- Codes (ISO3) can help

## Attribute Join 

- Is an issue in many different places
  - Irish placenames with fadas e.g. á, 
  - Spanish e.g. ñ
  - Any language using non-Roman characters, e.g. Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew,  Mandarin, Japanese, ...
  

- Is something AI might be able to help with 
  - Not seen any examples yet...

## Spatial Data

- Data is crucial to GIS
- ~50% of time doing a GIS project is spent finding data or getting data into the right format!
- Finding data can be a real pain
- Previous work **should** reference where they get data from 
- If not, it’s a reasonable question to ask the author
- There is no one list of data, but some useful sources

## Spatial Data - Is it any use?

- Location (where does it cover?)
- Variables / columns (what does it cover?)
- How old is the data? (when does it cover?)
- What projection & coordinate system is the data in?
- What scale is the data at?

## Scale {.smaller}

::: columns
:::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/lego-bus-1.png)

- Small number of bricks
- Low level of detail

Depends on size

## File Size

::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- More bricks = more data
- More data = bigger file
- In GIS, this is how much 
detail there is
- More detail means we can 
use it as a larger scale
- Generalisation

## Static Data

::: columns
:::: {.column width="70%"}

![](images/ch2-scale.png)

::::
:::: {.column width="30%"}

![](images/south-america.png){ width="20%" }
![](images/uk.png){ width="20%" }
![](images/hull.png){ width="20%" }

![](images/scale-range.png)

- Dynamic data
- Extra detail on demand

## Static vs Dynamic

- Dynamic data
  - Dynamic scale - pulls in additional data (from internet)
  - Not editable / usable for analysis (no attribute table)
  - Useful if data changes
- Static data
  - Fixed scale - can’t get additional data (need another file)
  - Editable and usable for analysis (attribute table)
  - Does not update




## Saving Files

![](images/saving-files-1.png)

## Saving Files

![](images/saving-files-2.png)


## Saving Files

![](images/saving-files-3.png)

## Shapefiles {.smaller}

![](images/shapefiles.png)

- `.shp` the geometry (polygons) themselves 
- `.shx` extra geometry information
- `.dbf` attribute information (dBase IV format)
- `.prj` projection & coordinate system info
- `.qpj` QGIS version of projection & coordinate system information *[(more gory details)](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/55545/qpj-files-on-esri-software)*

- *[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile)*

## Shapefiles

- (One of) the most common spatial data file formats
- ESRI 1990s, closed
- → [spec opened July 1998](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/sitecore-archive/Files/Pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf)

## Geopackage

![](images/geopackage.png){.absolute right="0" top="0"}

- Everything is contained in a single file
- Easier file management with GeoPackage 
- No multiple files! 
- Many layers in one file
- Faster work-flow than with shapefiles
- There are nearly no limitations on field names (10 char in shapefile)

## Geopackage

![](images/geopackage.png){.absolute right="0" top="0"}

- *An aside*
- *GeoPackages are databases*
- *Each layer is a table within the database*
- *Makes moving to PostGIS / PostgreSQL databases much easier*

## File Formats

- Mainly been using shapefiles
- They are just one of many formats
- You will come across more:
  - GeoPackage
  - GeoJSON
  - GML
  - And many others! 
- QGIS can read (most) of them

## Cartography and Map Design

- By the end of this practical you will be able to:
  - Understand how to design and produce a publication-ready map in QGIS 
  - Be able to add maps, scale bar, legends and labels to a map 
  - Know why scale is important in map design 
  - Know how to save and export maps as PDFs or images

- Exactly the same as referencing in an academic article

## Map Design

- What makes a good map?
- Darkes and Spence’s (2017) Cartography: An Introduction
- Examples
- Good and bad
- Rules of thumb
- [Second edition £10 + P&P](https://www.cartography.org.uk/cartography-introduction)

![](images/cartography-an-introduction.png){.absolute right=0 bottom=0 width=400}

## *~~Classification~~* Cartography

- Cartography is a Science and an Art
- Be creative
- There is no ‘right’ answer
- A bit like cookery 
- But there are some ‘rules of thumb’
- Borrow other people’s ideas
- Develop my design

## File Management

- File / Data Management is key
- Spatial data generates lots of files
- Having a system is crucial
-  Particularly if you have multiple people working on the same project

## Working with your own data

- Data is crucial to GIS
- ~50% of time doing a GIS project is spent finding data or getting data into the right format!
- Finding data can be a real pain
- Previous work **should** reference where they get data from 
- If not, it’s a reasonable question to ask the author
- 95% of the time you won’t have spatial data ready to go

## Working with your own data

- 95% of the time you won’t have spatial data ready to go

- You may have to join your own data to existing spatial data
  - e.g. population data

- Existing spatial data can come from various locations

## Working with your own data

Spatial data can come from various locations

- [Ordnance Survey / OS Open Data](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open)
- [Census & Census Boundary]( https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk)
- [EuroStat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat)
- [Free GIS Data, Robin Wilson](http://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/)
- [GeoBoundaries.org](https://GeoBoundaries.org)
- [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org)
- Google Search – shapefile / GIS

## Working with your own data

- 95% of the time you won’t have spatial data ready to go

- You may have to join your own data to existing spatial data
  - e.g. population data (pop table + Geo boundaries)

- Or create the vector data yourself
  - How do you do this?
  - Depends on points, lines and polygons

## Working with your own data

:::{.columns}
:::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/vector-data.png){}

::::
:::: {.column width="60%"}

- Points
  - Easy, `world-cities.csv` 
  - Using coordinates

- Lines & Polygons
  - Harder
  - Not common to create new data (digitizing)
  - Common to combining existing data to create new data
